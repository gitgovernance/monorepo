# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Diagram Module is a core component of the GitGovernance system that transforms structured project data from `.gitgov/` records into visual diagrams. This module serves as the foundational engine for diagram generation, providing programmatic APIs for creating Mermaid diagrams from CycleRecord and TaskRecord entities. The module emphasizes data integrity, relationship analysis, and flexible rendering while maintaining separation of concerns from CLI interfaces and user interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the GitGovernance SDK, I want to programmatically generate diagrams from project records, so that I can integrate visualization capabilities into custom tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DiagramGenerator.generateFromFiles() is called with a valid .gitgov path THEN the system SHALL load all CycleRecord and TaskRecord entities
2. WHEN DiagramGenerator.generateFromRecords() is called with record arrays THEN the system SHALL process the provided entities directly
3. WHEN the generation process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a valid Mermaid diagram string
4. WHEN invalid records are encountered THEN the system SHALL throw ValidationError with specific details about the malformed data
5. WHEN no records are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty diagram with appropriate metadata
6. WHEN the system processes records THEN it SHALL preserve all relationship information from childCycleIds and taskIds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the diagram module to analyze and validate record relationships, so that I can ensure data integrity and detect structural issues in project hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RelationshipAnalyzer processes records THEN the system SHALL build a complete dependency graph of all entities
2. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL throw CircularDependencyError with the complete cycle path
3. WHEN duplicate record IDs are found THEN the system SHALL emit warnings and deduplicate automatically
4. WHEN orphaned records exist THEN the system SHALL identify and report them as warnings
5. WHEN invalid relationships are detected THEN the system SHALL validate that referenced IDs exist in the dataset
6. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide a validated graph structure for rendering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating diagram generation, I want flexible filtering capabilities, so that I can generate focused views of specific project areas without loading unnecessary data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a cycle filter is applied THEN the system SHALL include the target cycle, its child cycles, and all associated tasks
2. WHEN a task filter is applied THEN the system SHALL include the target task and all cycles that contain it
3. WHEN a package filter is applied THEN the system SHALL include only entities matching the specified package scope
4. WHEN a status filter is applied THEN the system SHALL include only entities with matching status values
5. WHEN a depth filter is applied THEN the system SHALL limit the hierarchy to the specified number of levels
6. WHEN multiple filters are combined THEN the system SHALL apply them using logical AND operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visualization consumer, I want the diagram module to generate semantically correct Mermaid syntax, so that the output can be reliably rendered by Mermaid processors and integrated into documentation systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MermaidRenderer processes a graph THEN the system SHALL generate valid Mermaid flowchart syntax
2. WHEN rendering CycleRecord entities THEN the system SHALL use hexagonal node shapes to denote strategic nature
3. WHEN rendering TaskRecord entities THEN the system SHALL use rectangular node shapes to denote operational nature
4. WHEN generating node labels THEN the system SHALL sanitize text to prevent Mermaid syntax conflicts
5. WHEN creating relationships THEN the system SHALL generate proper edge syntax with appropriate arrow types
6. WHEN the diagram is complex THEN the system SHALL optimize layout for readability while preserving semantic meaning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a configuration manager, I want the diagram module to integrate with GitGovernance configuration, so that it can automatically apply project-specific settings and defaults.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ConfigManager.getRootCycle() returns a value THEN the system SHALL use it as the default filter when no explicit filters are provided
2. WHEN ConfigManager.findProjectRoot() is called THEN the system SHALL locate the nearest .gitgov directory in the directory hierarchy
3. WHEN configuration contains diagram settings THEN the system SHALL apply them as rendering defaults
4. WHEN no configuration is found THEN the system SHALL use sensible built-in defaults
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw ConfigurationError with specific validation details
6. WHEN multiple configuration sources exist THEN the system SHALL apply precedence rules correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can identify and resolve data quality issues in GitGovernance projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malformed JSON records are encountered THEN the system SHALL throw ValidationError with file path and specific parsing details
2. WHEN required fields are missing from records THEN the system SHALL throw ValidationError identifying the missing fields and affected records
3. WHEN file system errors occur THEN the system SHALL throw FileSystemError with appropriate error context
4. WHEN memory limits are approached THEN the system SHALL throw ResourceError before system instability occurs
5. WHEN generation timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL throw TimeoutError with progress information
6. WHEN warnings are generated THEN the system SHALL collect them in a structured format for external consumption

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want the diagram module to handle large datasets efficiently, so that it can scale to enterprise-sized GitGovernance projects without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large record sets THEN the system SHALL use streaming approaches to minimize memory usage
2. WHEN analyzing relationships THEN the system SHALL use efficient graph algorithms with O(n log n) or better complexity
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL optimize string operations to prevent excessive memory allocation
4. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL provide optional caching mechanisms for repeated operations
5. WHEN progress tracking is needed THEN the system SHALL provide callback mechanisms for long-running operations
6. WHEN resource limits are configured THEN the system SHALL respect them and fail gracefully when exceeded

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want clean separation between data processing and rendering concerns, so that I can extend the module with custom renderers and output formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module processes data THEN it SHALL separate analysis logic from rendering logic through clear interfaces
2. WHEN custom renderers are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a RendererInterface that can be implemented independently
3. WHEN different output formats are required THEN the system SHALL support pluggable renderer implementations
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear extension points without requiring core modifications
5. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL allow mocking of individual components through dependency injection
6. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide serializable intermediate representations of processed data

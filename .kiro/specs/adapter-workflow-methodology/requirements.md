# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Workflow Methodology Adapter is a **configurable rules engine** that decouples the workflow engine (`BacklogAdapter`) from specific business rules (the active `Methodology`). This allows teams to operate under different governance rules without modifying the core system code, using schema-driven JSON configuration files.

## Requirements

### Initiative 1: Core Validation Engine

**User Story:** As a `BacklogAdapter`, I want to validate state transitions, signatures, and custom rules according to a configurable methodology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a state transition is attempted, THEN the system SHALL validate it against the `state_transitions` rules in the active methodology configuration.
2.  WHEN a signature is provided for an action, THEN the system SHALL validate the actor's `capability_roles` against the guild-specific `signatures` rules.
3.  WHEN a transition requires custom rules (e.g., `assignment_required`), THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding validation logic.

### Initiative 2: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer or administrator, I want to manage and apply different workflow methodologies to my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a methodology configuration file is loaded, THEN the system SHALL validate it against the `workflow_methodology_schema.yaml`.
2.  WHEN an invalid configuration is provided, THEN the system SHALL return a `DetailedValidationError` with specific field-level errors.
3.  WHEN `reloadConfig()` is called, THEN the system SHALL hot-reload the configuration from disk, validating it before applying.

### Initiative 3: UI & System Integration

**User Story:** As a UI developer or system integrator, I want to retrieve view configurations and rely on robust system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `getViewConfig()` is called, THEN the system SHALL return the column-to-status mappings for the requested view (e.g., `kanban-4col`).
2.  WHEN optional dependencies (like `feedbackStore`) are missing, THEN the adapter **must** degrade gracefully, skipping dependent custom rules.
3.  WHEN any validation method is called, THEN it **must** execute in under 50ms for typical scenarios.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Execution Adapter is the **"chronicler"** of the GitGovernance system. Its primary responsibility is to create and manage immutable `ExecutionRecords`, which serve as the audit log of all work performed. It implements the rules from `execution_protocol.md` and emits `execution.created` events for system coordination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Record Creation & Validation

**User Story:** As a system actor, I want to register execution events for tasks to create an immutable audit log of work performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `create()` is called with a valid payload THEN the system SHALL construct, sign, and persist an `ExecutionRecord`.
2. WHEN `create()` is called with an invalid payload (e.g., missing `result`, short `result`, or invalid `taskId`) THEN the system SHALL throw a `DetailedValidationError` or `RecordNotFoundError`.
3. WHEN `create()` is successful THEN the system SHALL emit an `execution.created` event.

### Requirement 2: Record Query & Retrieval

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to retrieve execution records to analyze progress and history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `getExecution()` is called with an existing ID THEN the system SHALL return the corresponding `ExecutionRecord`.
2. WHEN `getExecution()` is called with a non-existent ID THEN the system SHALL return `null`.
3. WHEN `getExecutionsByTask()` is called THEN the system SHALL return a filtered array of all `ExecutionRecords` for that task.
4. WHEN `getAllExecutions()` is called THEN the system SHALL return an array of all `ExecutionRecords` in the system.

### Requirement 3: System Integration & Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the adapter to be a reliable and performant component of the ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the adapter is instantiated without an optional `taskStore` THEN it SHALL operate gracefully, skipping `taskId` validation but logging a warning.
2. WHEN any method is called THEN it SHALL execute in under 30ms for typical datasets.
3. WHEN implemented THEN the adapter SHALL be fully type-safe with no `any` types.

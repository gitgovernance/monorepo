# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MetricsAdapter is a **pure calculation engine** that transforms GitGovernance records into quantifiable metrics. It serves as the mathematical core for analytics, providing insights into system health, productivity, and collaboration. It implements a tiered approach, with Tier 1 (MVP) and Tier 2 (Productivity) metrics being the current focus.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Health & Status (Tier 1)

**User Story:** As an operator, I want real-time health metrics to monitor workflow status and identify issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `getSystemStatus()` is called THEN the system SHALL return a `SystemStatus` object with health score, task distribution, and cycle metrics.
2. WHEN `getTaskHealth()` is called for a valid task THEN the system SHALL return a `TaskHealthReport` with staleness, blocking feedback age, and time in stage.
3. WHEN `getTaskHealth()` is called for a non-existent task THEN the system SHALL throw a `RecordNotFoundError`.

### Requirement 2: Productivity & Collaboration Metrics (Tier 2)

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want productivity and collaboration metrics to optimize our delivery process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `getProductivityMetrics()` is called THEN the system SHALL return metrics including `throughput`, `leadTime`, and `cycleTime`.
2. WHEN `getCollaborationMetrics()` is called THEN the system SHALL return metrics including the number of `activeAgents`.

### Requirement 3: Architectural Integrity & Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable and performant calculation engine that is architecturally sound.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any calculation function is called THEN the system SHALL behave as a pure function with same input producing same output and no side effects.
2. WHEN optional data stores are missing THEN the adapter SHALL degrade gracefully, returning default values for dependent metrics.
3. WHEN unimplemented Tier 3 or 4 functions are called THEN the system SHALL throw a `NotImplementedError`.
4. WHEN mathematical edge cases like division by zero occur THEN the system SHALL return `0` gracefully.
5. WHEN Tier 1 methods are called THEN the system SHALL execute in under 100ms.
6. WHEN Tier 2 methods are called THEN the system SHALL execute in under 200ms.

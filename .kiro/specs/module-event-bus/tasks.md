# Implementation Plan

Convert the Event Bus Module design into actionable coding tasks that build incrementally toward a complete pub/sub system.

---

- [x] **1. Set up Event Bus Module structure and core interfaces**
  - Create module directory structure in `packages/core/src/modules/event_bus_module/`
  - Define `IEventStream` interface with `publish`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe` methods
  - Create base event types and `EventHandler` type definitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] **2. Implement core EventBus class with pub/sub functionality**
  - Create `EventBus` class implementing `IEventStream` interface
  - Implement `publish` method that validates events and notifies subscribers
  - Implement `subscribe` method that registers handlers and returns subscription IDs
  - Implement `unsubscribe` method that removes handlers by subscription ID
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] **3. Create canonical event catalog with type safety**
  - Define all 9 canonical event types (`task.created`, `task.status.changed`, etc.)
  - Create strongly-typed payload interfaces for each event type
  - Implement `GitGovEvent` union type for comprehensive type safety
  - Add runtime validation for event structures before publishing
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [x] **4. Implement error isolation and robustness**
  - Wrap all event handler invocations in try/catch blocks
  - Log handler errors without stopping event propagation to other handlers
  - Ensure failing handlers don't affect system stability
  - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [x] **5. Add management and debugging capabilities**
  - Implement `getSubscriptionCount` method to return handler counts per event type
  - Implement `getActiveEventTypes` method to list all event types with active subscriptions
  - Implement `subscribeToAll` method for wildcard event monitoring
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] **6. Implement hybrid singleton/DI pattern for system integration**
  - Export global `publishEvent` function for easy producer access
  - Ensure `IEventStream` interface supports dependency injection for consumers
  - Create singleton EventBus instance for CLI usage
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] **7. Write comprehensive test suite**
  - Create unit tests for core pub/sub functionality (publish, subscribe, unsubscribe)
  - Write integration tests for event flow between multiple subscribers
  - Add tests for error isolation and handler failure scenarios
  - Test type safety and event validation
  - Verify management APIs (subscription counts, active event types)
  - _Requirements: All EARS requirements_

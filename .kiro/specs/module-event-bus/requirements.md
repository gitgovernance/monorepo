# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Event Bus Module is the **nervous system** of the GitGovernance ecosystem. It provides a decoupled communication layer that allows adapters to notify the rest of the system about significant state changes in an asynchronous, robust, and type-safe manner. It supports a "dual bus" architecture to serve both local, offline-first operations and a collaborative, cloud-based premium tier.

## Requirements

### Initiative 1: Core Pub/Sub Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable pub/sub system to decouple communication between different adapters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN an event is published using `publish()`, THEN all subscribed handlers for that event type **must** be invoked asynchronously.
2.  WHEN a handler is subscribed using `subscribe()`, THEN it **must** receive all subsequent events of that specific type.
3.  WHEN `unsubscribe()` is called with a valid subscription ID, THEN the corresponding handler **must** no longer receive events.
4.  WHEN an event is published, it **must** be validated against the canonical event schemas to ensure type safety.

### Initiative 2: System Integration & Decoupling

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to ensure adapters are fully decoupled and communicate only through the event bus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN an adapter performs a write operation (e.g., `BacklogAdapter.createTask`), THEN it **must** emit the corresponding event (e.g., `task.created`) only after the data has been successfully persisted.
2.  WHEN an adapter needs to react to a state change in another domain (e.g., `BacklogAdapter` reacting to `feedback.created`), THEN it **must** do so by subscribing to the relevant event, not by calling the other adapter directly.
3.  WHEN the system is running, THEN the `EventBus` **must** provide a global `publishEvent` function for producers and support dependency injection of the `IEventStream` interface for consumers.

### Initiative 3: Robustness & Manageability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a robust event bus with error isolation and management capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a subscribed event handler throws an error, THEN it **must not** affect the execution of other handlers for the same event (error isolation).
2.  WHEN the system is running, THEN it **must** be possible to get a list of all active subscriptions and the count of handlers per event type for debugging and monitoring.
3.  WHEN `subscribeToAll()` is used, THEN the handler **must** receive every event published on the bus, regardless of its type.

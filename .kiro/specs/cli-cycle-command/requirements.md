# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `gitgov cycle` command is the primary interface for **strategic planning** in GitGovernance. It allows users to manage `CycleRecords` (milestones, sprints, epics), which provide context and purpose to the tactical work defined in `TaskRecords`.

## Requirements

### Initiative 1: Core Cycle Lifecycle & Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage the complete lifecycle of cycles and their hierarchical relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `gitgov cycle new` is used, THEN the system SHALL create a new `CycleRecord`, using `$EDITOR` or flags for input, and delegate persistence to the `BacklogAdapter`.
2.  WHEN `gitgov cycle activate` or `gitgov cycle complete` is used, THEN the system SHALL transition the cycle's state after validating the readiness of its tasks and children.
3.  WHEN `gitgov cycle add-task` is used, THEN a bidirectional link **must** be created between the specified cycle and task(s).
4.  WHEN `gitgov cycle add-child` is used, THEN a bidirectional parent-child relationship **must** be established, preventing circular references.

### Initiative 2: Query & Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to list and view cycles with high performance and rich detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `gitgov cycle list` is used, THEN the system SHALL display cycles from the `IndexerAdapter` cache, with advanced filtering options.
2.  WHEN `gitgov cycle show <id>` is used, THEN the system SHALL display enriched details for a specific cycle, including its task and child hierarchies.

### Initiative 3: CLI Experience & Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent, reliable, and fast CLI experience for strategic planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a read command is used, THEN the system **must** check cache freshness and auto-regenerate if stale.
2.  WHEN a write command is used, THEN the system **must** invalidate the cache to ensure consistency.
3.  WHEN any operation fails, THEN the system **must** provide a user-friendly error with an actionable suggestion.
4.  WHEN standard flags like `--json` or `--verbose` are used, THEN the command's output **must** adjust accordingly.

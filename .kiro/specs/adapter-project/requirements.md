# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Adapter is the **project initialization engine** of the GitGovernance ecosystem. It **orchestrates** the complete setup of GitGovernance projects, from cryptographic bootstrap to template processing, establishing the foundation for the governance ecosystem. This adapter serves as the central **coordinator** that brings together identity management, backlog creation, workflow methodology, and configuration persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize a new GitGovernance project with a single command, so that I can quickly get a complete governance structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `initializeProject` is invoked with valid options THEN the system SHALL **orchestrate** a complete project setup with multi-adapter coordination and an Ed25519 trust root.
2.  WHEN project initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a `ProjectInitResult` with `projectId`, `rootCycle`, and actor metadata.
3.  WHEN initialization fails at any step THEN the system SHALL invoke `rollbackPartialSetup` automatically for cleanup.
4.  WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create the canonical `.gitgov` directory structure.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to validate my environment before initialization, so that I can be confident the setup will succeed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `validateEnvironment` is invoked THEN the system SHALL verify Git repository existence, write permissions, and the absence of a previous `.gitgov` setup.
2.  WHEN environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL return an `EnvironmentValidation` result with specific warnings and actionable suggestions.
3.  WHEN `.gitgov` already exists THEN the system SHALL detect this and prevent duplicate initialization.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use project templates to bootstrap my project with predefined cycles and tasks, so that I can start with a structured workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `processBlueprintTemplate` is invoked with valid JSON THEN the system SHALL **orchestrate** the creation of cycles and tasks using the respective factories and adapters.
2.  WHEN template JSON is invalid THEN the system SHALL throw a `DetailedValidationError` with field-level error details.
3.  WHEN template processing completes THEN the system SHALL return a `TemplateProcessingResult` with counts of created cycles and tasks.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic error recovery during project initialization, so that failed setups don't leave my environment in a broken state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN a rollback is executed THEN the system SHALL remove the `.gitgov` directory and restore the environment to its previous state.
2.  WHEN any adapter dependency fails during setup THEN the system SHALL capture the error with specific context for troubleshooting.
3.  WHEN a partial setup exists after a failure THEN the system SHALL clean up all artifacts, including configuration files and generated keys.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project adapter to correctly **coordinate** with other core adapters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN trust root creation is required THEN the system SHALL delegate to `IdentityAdapter.createActor`.
2.  WHEN root cycle creation is required THEN the system SHALL delegate to `BacklogAdapter.createCycle`.
3.  WHEN template tasks are processed THEN the system SHALL delegate to `BacklogAdapter.createTask`.
4.  WHEN configuration persistence is required THEN the system SHALL use `ConfigManager` for all write/read operations.

### Requirement 6 (Future - Platform)

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage project configurations and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  WHEN `getProjectInfo` is invoked THEN the system SHALL return project metadata from `config.json` via `ConfigManager`.
2.  WHEN `updateProjectConfig` is invoked THEN the system SHALL validate and persist updates via `ConfigManager`.
3.  WHEN `generateProjectReport` is invoked THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive report with statistics and health analysis.

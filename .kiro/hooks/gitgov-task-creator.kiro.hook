When executed, help create GitGovernance tasks with intelligent context:\n\n## Context Analysis\n1. **Check currently open files in the editor**\n2. **Identify project area**: core, cli, protocol, platform, saas\n3. **Determine component type**: adapter, command, module, spec\n4. **Extract relevant context from file paths and names**\n\n## Smart Suggestions\nBased on current context, provide suggestions:\n- If in adapter file: \"Create task for [AdapterName] enhancement/fix?\"\n- If in command file: \"Create task for CLI command improvement?\"\n- If in spec file: \"Create implementation task for this specification?\"\n- If no specific context: \"Create general project task?\"\n\n## Interactive Task Creation\n1. **Prompt for task title with context-aware suggestions**\n2. **Suggest relevant tags based on current context**:\n   - File in packages/core â†’ suggest \"core\" tag\n   - File in BacklogAdapter â†’ suggest \"backlog-adapter\" tag\n   - File in CLI â†’ suggest \"cli\" tag\n3. **Suggest priority based on project health and current work**\n\n## Template Suggestions\nBased on your context, here are some task templates:\nðŸ”§ Bug Fix: \"Fix [component] [specific issue]\"\nâœ¨ Feature: \"Implement [functionality] in [component]\"\nðŸ“š Documentation: \"Document [component/feature] usage\"\nðŸ§ª Testing: \"Add tests for [component/feature]\"\nðŸ”„ Refactor: \"Refactor [component] for [reason]\"\n\n## Automated Task Creation\n1. **Generate `gitgov task new` command with suggested parameters**\n2. **Include relevant tags, priority, and description**\n3. **Execute command after user confirmation**\n4. **Show created task ID and next steps**\n\n## Integration with Current Work\n- Check active cycles and suggest adding task to relevant cycle\n- If no active cycle, suggest creating one for related work\n- Link to existing tasks if similar work is in progress\n\n## Quick Actions After Creation\n- \"Task created! What's next?\"\n- Options: \"Assign to me\", \"Add to cycle\", \"Start working\", \"Create another\"\n- Execute follow-up commands based on user choice\n\n## Error Handling\n- If task creation fails: Show specific error and retry options\n- If GitGovernance not initialized: Guide through initialization\n- Validate input and provide helpful corrections\n\nAlways make task creation fast and contextually relevant to current work. Focus on intelligent suggestions based on the workspace state and current files being edited."

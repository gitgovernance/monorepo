**An Operating System for Intelligent Work, built on a Git-based ledger.**

GitGovernance provides the infrastructure of trust to orchestrate collaboration between human and AI agents, bringing engineering discipline to hybrid teams.

## The Vision: Why GitGovernance?

In the era of AI, high-performance teams face a new kind of chaos: zero accountability, coordination silos, and inconsistent quality. Leaders operate blindly, unable to see progress or risks in time.

GitGovernance is not another management tool. It's a foundational protocol layer that unifies all work into an immutable, auditable, and signed ledger. We built it on Git because it's the most robust and adopted distributed traceability system in the world.

Our core principle is a **Protocol-First Approach**. Every component is first defined as a formal specification‚Äîa contract readable by both humans and LLMs‚Äîbefore a single line of code is written. This ensures that the system's logic is guided by a clear purpose that an AI can understand and audit.

## üîß Developer Guide

This guide is for contributors who want to work on the GitGovernance ecosystem.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm

### Setup and Verification

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gitgovernance/monorepo.git
    cd monorepo
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Verify the packages:**

    This command builds the code and runs all tests for both `core` and `cli`.

    ```bash
    pnpm -r verify
    ```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# To run the CLI with hot-reloading:
cd packages/cli
pnpm dev status

# To test the CLI system-wide (from any directory):
cd packages/cli
pnpm build && npm link

# Now you can use `gitgov` anywhere
gitgov status
```

## ü§ù Contribution Flow

- **Changes to Open Source Packages (`core`, `cli`):** Must be made in the corresponding `upstream` submodule repository. Once merged, the submodule pointer is updated in this monorepo.

## üîß IDE Integration

### Kiro IDE Integration

GitGovernance includes native integration with [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev), a next-generation development environment designed for AI-human collaboration, for an optimized development experience:

- **Agent Hooks:** Automatic hooks for creating tasks, analyzing files, and managing commits
- **Git Diagnostics:** Automatic correlation between commits and TaskRecords
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Task export to Kiro Spec format

## üéØ Current Implementation Status (September 2025)

## ü§ù Converse with Your Project

GitGovernance is more than a set of commands; it's a system you can converse with. Our AI agent, `@gitgov`, acts as your project co-pilot.

Instead of memorizing commands, you can ask the agent in natural language to check the project's health, assign work, or identify priorities. The agent uses the `gitgov` CLI on your behalf, giving you access to the full power of the system.

### Example Interactions

#### **Project Health Check**

- **You:** `"@gitgov, how are we doing?"`
- **Agent:** `"Our backlog health is at 87%, but task 'Refactor Compiler' has been stalled for 12 days, and there are 3 critical blockers. Throughput is excellent, but our lead time is high."`
- _Run `gitgov status --health --alerts` for full details._

#### **Work Assignment**

- **You:** `"@gitgov, what should I work on next?"`
- **Agent:** `"You have one high-priority feedback item assigned to you: 'Refactor Compiler', which is blocking 3 other tasks. This is critical."`
- _Use `gitgov task show <task-id>` for details._

#### **Blocking Issues**

- **You:** `"@gitgov, what's blocked?"`
- **Agent:** `"There are 3 critical blockers: Task X (12 days), Task Y (8 days), and Task Z (5 days). I recommend prioritizing these to improve project flow."`
- _Use `gitgov task list --status blocked` for analysis._

### üéØ **Dashboard Views - Multi-Methodology Support**

GitGovernance includes a sophisticated TUI dashboard with multiple views for different workflows:

#### **Row-Based View (Default)**

```bash
gitgov dashboard  # Default view
```

- **Integrated View**: Shows multiple adapters working in coordination
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- **Activity Stream**: Live system activity with agent collaboration
- **Interactive Controls**: Keyboard shortcuts for quick actions

#### **Kanban Workflow View**

```bash
gitgov dashboard --template=kanban-7col
```

- **7-Column Layout**: Draft ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Done ‚Üí Archived ‚Üí Blocked
- **Flow Intelligence**: Bottleneck detection and flow acceleration
- **WIP Limits**: Visual warnings for column capacity
- **Cycle Time Tracking**: Performance metrics per stage

#### **Scrum Ceremonies View**

```bash
gitgov dashboard --template=scrum-board
```

- **Sprint Focus**: Product Backlog ‚Üí Sprint Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done ‚Üí Demo Ready
- **Sprint Intelligence**: Burndown charts and velocity tracking
- **Ceremony Reminders**: Daily standups and sprint reviews
- **Impediment Detection**: Blocked tasks with escalation alerts

#### **Interactive Controls**

- **v**: Cycle between views (Row ‚Üí Kanban ‚Üí Scrum ‚Üí loop)
- **1-3**: Direct view selection (1: Row, 2: Kanban, 3: Scrum)
- **s**: Sort tasks by Recent Activity, Creation Date, Priority, or Status
- **r**: Manual refresh, **?**: Help, **q**: Quit
- **n,s,a,e,c**: Educational shortcuts (shows CLI commands)

### üìä **Performance Metrics**

- **Core Tests**: 503 passing (100% success rate)
- **CLI Tests**: 164 passing (100% success rate)
- **Cache Performance**: 146 records indexed in ~50ms

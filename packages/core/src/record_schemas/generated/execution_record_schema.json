Extend with 'custom:' for your domain.\nPrimitive types:\n  - analysis: Investigation, research, or evaluation before acting.\n  - decision: A choice that changes the direction of work.\n  - progress: Incremental advancement of work.\n  - blocker: An impediment preventing further progress.\n  - completion: Work on the task is finished.\n  - correction: A fix to something previously done incorrectly.\n  - info: Informational note or status update.\n\nCustom types use the 'custom:' prefix for industry-specific extensions. Software development examples:\n  - custom:review (code review, design review, QA)\n  - custom:deployment (deploy to staging/production)\n  - custom:rollback (revert a deployment or change)\n  - custom:release (version release, PR merge to main)\n  - custom:hotfix (emergency fix in production)\nImplementations that encounter an unrecognized custom type MUST treat it as 'info' for display purposes.\n"

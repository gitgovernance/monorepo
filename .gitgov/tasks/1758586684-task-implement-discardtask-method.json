    "description": "Implemented discardTask method in BacklogAdapter to replace cancelTask for better semantic consistency. The method handles both cancellation (from ready/active states) and rejection (from review state) operations, transitioning tasks to 'discarded' status. Key improvements:\\n\\n- Renamed cancelTask() to discardTask() across entire codebase for semantic clarity\\n- Method supports both cancel and reject operations with automatic reason prefixing\\n- Updated all documentation in backlog_adapter.md and task_command.md  \\n- Updated CLI task-command.ts to use new method name\\n- Updated all test files to use discardTask terminology\\n- Maintains backward compatibility - same functionality, better naming\\n- All 643 core tests passing after rename\\n- Method detects context and uses [CANCELLED] or [REJECTED] prefixes automatically\\n- Supports optional reason parameter for both operations\\n\\nFiles updated:\\n- packages/core/src/adapters/backlog_adapter/index.ts (interface + implementation)\\n- packages/cli/src/commands/task/task-command.ts (method calls)\\n- packages/blueprints/03_products/core/specs/adapters/backlog_adapter.md (documentation)\\n- packages/blueprints/03_products/cli/specs/task_command.md (CLI specs)\\n- packages/core/src/adapters/backlog_adapter/backlog_adapter.test.ts (tests)\\n\\nThis change improves semantic consistency since both cancel and reject operations result in 'discarded' status, making discardTask a more accurate method name.",

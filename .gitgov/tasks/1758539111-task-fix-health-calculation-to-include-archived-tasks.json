    "description": "Fix critical health calculation bug where archived tasks are excluded, causing dramatic drops (90% → 2%) during archiving operations. Branch: fix/health-calculation-archived-tasks. Implementation: Optimize calculateHealth() from 6 filters to 1 reduce, add archived tasks with 100% weight. Files: metrics_adapter/index.ts (line 447), metrics_adapter.test.ts. Update EARS-8 test and add regression test. Expected: Stable health during archiving, improved performance, blueprint compliance.",

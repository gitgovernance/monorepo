    "title": "Implementation of dynamic task sorting with EnrichedTaskRecord",
    "result": "Successfully implemented dynamic task sorting functionality in GitGovernance Dashboard using IndexerAdapter with EnrichedTaskRecord. Key deliverables: (1) Added EnrichedTaskRecord type with lastUpdated, lastActivityType, recentActivity fields. (2) Implemented calculateLastUpdated() method with file modification detection and related records analysis. (3) Implemented enrichTaskRecord() method for task enhancement. (4) Integrated enrichedTasks generation in IndexerAdapter.generateIndex(). (5) Updated Dashboard to consume enrichedTasks from IndexerAdapter cache. (6) Fixed critical path resolution bug for project root detection. (7) Fixed timestamp consistency bug (all timestamps in milliseconds). (8) Implemented smart modification detection with 60-second threshold. (9) Verified functionality: Hook 7 and Hook 9 correctly appear in sorted order after status changes. (10) Updated documentation with 12 new EARS across indexer_adapter.md and dashboard_command.md. Implementation is complete and fully functional.",
    "notes": "This execution represents the completion of a complex feature that required debugging two critical bugs: path resolution and timestamp consistency. The implementation follows the documented architecture from the blueprints and includes comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation.",
